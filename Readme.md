# üöÄ CS50‚Äôs Introduction to Programming with Python

This repository tracks my progress through Harvard's **CS50P: Introduction to Programming with Python** ‚Äî a foundational course that deepens understanding of programming fundamentals using Python.

I‚Äôm documenting this as part of my journey to become a bridge between **law and technology**, building tools that are both useful and mindful.

## üß† Why I'm Doing This

I believe every lawyer should learn to think like a programmer ‚Äî clearly, precisely, and with the power to automate. This course is one of many steps I‚Äôm taking to merge two worlds: **legal expertise + code fluency**.

## üìå Highlights So Far

- Built CLI tools using `argparse`
- Automated file handling with `os` and `sys`
- Practiced TDD using Python‚Äôs `unittest`
- Applied clean coding principles early on

## ‚ö° Up Next

- Deep dive into **Regular Expressions** (`re`)
- Reflective notes from **Et Cetera** (Week 9)
- Polish and publish my **Final Project**
